SELECT MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
       MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,
       AVG(rental_duration) AS avg_rental_duration,
       MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,
       MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,
       AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate,
       MIN(length) AS min_film_length,
       MAX(length) AS max_film_length,
       AVG(length) AS avg_film_length,
       MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost,
       MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement_cost,
       AVG(replacement_cost) AS avg_replacement_cost,
       mode() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY release_year) AS mode_year,
       mode() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY language_id) AS mode_language,
       mode() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS mode_rating
