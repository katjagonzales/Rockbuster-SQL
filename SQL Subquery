SQL subquery used to find how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

SELECT D.country,
       COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id ) AS top_customer_count
FROM country D 
INNER JOIN city C ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN address B ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer A ON A.address_id = B.address_id
LEFT JOIN 
     (SELECT A.customer_id,
	     A.first_name,
	     A.last_name,
	     C.city,
	     D.country,
             SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
      FROM customer A
      INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
      INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
      INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
      INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
      WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule(Dhulia)',
		     'Kurashiki', 'Russian Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
      GROUP BY A.customer_id,
	       C.city,
	       D.country
      ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
      LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON D.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
