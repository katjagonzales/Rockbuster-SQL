# Rockbuster-SQL
Using SQL queries in PostgreSQL to analyze the database of a fictitious movie rental company as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program.
## **Objective**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictitious movie rental company that wants to transition from brick-and-mortar rental stores to an online video rental service 
in order to stay competitive.

The goal of this project was to answer business questions and make recommendations that help to develop a strategic plan for launching their new online rental service.
To assist Rockbuster in their informed decision making, data driven insights were gained by analyzing rental patterns of their current customer base.
